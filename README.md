Hello, innovators! We are thrilled that you've decided to be a part of Hackstack Pakistan 2023. This journey promises to be packed with learning, innovation, and challenges. Your passion and creativity will be the driving force behind the next wave of tech advancements in Pakistan.

## Getting Started ðŸ› 

1. **Set up Your Repository**  
   - Before diving in, make sure to remove this README file from your project. Replace it with a README that gives details about your project, the tech stack used, how to set it up, and any other relevant information that judges or other viewers might need.
   - Make sure to keep ALL your code in this repository. For example, if you have a backend and a frontend, create two folders named `backend` and `frontend` respectively to keep everything in this repository.

2. **Follow the Rules**  
   - It's crucial to adhere to the guidelines and rules of the hackathon. This ensures a fair and enjoyable experience for all. You can find the detailed rules and regulations [here](https://codewithahsan.dev/events/hackstack/2023).
   - It is also important to push your commits every day. This helps us keep track of regular coding practices.

3. **Stay Updated**  
   We'll be pushing updates, announcements, and important information through our discord. Make sure to stay connected (install the discord mobile app if you have not already) to avoid missing out on any crucial details.
